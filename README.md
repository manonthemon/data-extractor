# Data Extractor


![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

  ## Description 
  This is a simple python application which can be used to extract phone numbers and e-mail addresses from copied text. Once the data is extracted, it's automatically copied into clipboard for further use.
  
  I've built this application to practice python basics such as:

  - Writing regex code
  - Writing for loops
  - Installing and using third party modules such as pyperclip
  - Writing batch files


## Usage
To use the application:

1. Copy any text containing email addresses and phone numbers to clipboard. 
2. Run the application by opening the .bat file
3. The email addresses and phone numbers are now copied. You can paste them to your desired destination document.

  
 ## Contributing
I developed this app following the instructions from https://automatetheboringstuff.com python course.
